## Prerequisites
### To get started, ensure you have the following installed:

MongoDB
Mongoose
Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Starts the development server, including both frontend and backend (if configured).
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

This command watches for changes and reloads the server automatically.

### `npm test`

Runs the test suite in watch mode, checking for any errors or warnings in your code.
See the Testing documentation for further information.

### `npm run build`

Compiles the app for production, optimizing the code for performance.
The frontend code will be placed in the build folder and is ready for deployment.

### `npm run backend`
This command starts only the backend server. Use this if you want to test backend routes independently.
Typically, the backend server runs on http://localhost:5000.

#### Project Structure
The project includes the following main folders:

backend: Contains server code, database models, and API routes.
frontend: Includes all the React components and UI elements.
